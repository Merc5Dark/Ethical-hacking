# Introduction
Welcome to the world of ethical hacking! This README provides an overview of what ethical hacking is, the responsibilities of an ethical hacker, the methodology they follow, and the tools they use to ensure the security of computer systems and networks.

## What is Ethical Hacking?
Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Unlike malicious hackers (black-hat hackers) who exploit these vulnerabilities for personal gain or mischief, ethical hackers do so with the permission and for the benefit of the system owner. The primary goal is to strengthen security by addressing weaknesses before they can be exploited by unauthorized individuals.

## The Role of an Ethical Hacker
An ethical hacker is a professional who is hired to break into computer systems and networks, following a strict code of conduct. Their role includes:

Identifying Vulnerabilities: Ethical hackers seek out weaknesses in the system's security, including software flaws, misconfigurations, and potential points of entry.

Penetration Testing: They attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access, much like a malicious hacker would, but with permission.

Security Assessment: Conducting a thorough evaluation of the organization's security measures, including hardware, software, and policies.

Reporting: Documenting and reporting vulnerabilities, along with recommendations for mitigation, to the system owner.

Remediation Support: Assisting the organization in implementing the necessary fixes and security enhancements.
